## Roadmap
CaesarLib is developed as part of EnviousBox and is part of EnviousBox's roadmap and lifecycle.

Please refer to that for a more comprehensive roadmap.

For CaesarLib specifically, adding support for foreign languages that use the latin alphabet with accents would be nice to add in the future as well as additional language support more broadly.
