# caesar
A cli program to encode or decode text or a file using [the Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher), either using a number provided or a random number.

Don't use this for sensitive or secret information. The Caesar Cipher can be decoded by brute force (See [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher#Breaking_the_cipher)).
